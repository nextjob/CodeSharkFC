Linux Mint Install

Install on new build:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install freecad


On Mint (Ubuntu) we need to create these links: rem ln -s source_file symbolic_link

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/freecad/Mod /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Mod
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/freecad/Ext /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Ext

We need these links because when executing Application startup (import FreeCAD) from an external python interpreter,
AppHomePath is resolved as /usr/lib/freecad-python3 (which is the location of FreeCAD.so).
 (See Application.cpp & FreeCADInit.py in source)
This results in FreeCAD.getHomePath as returning /usr/lib/freecad-python3 and setting the Mod dir as /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Mod.
The correct location is /usr/lib/freecad/Mod, adding these links resolves this issue.

Serial port issues:

Cannot open /dev/ttyS0: Permission denied                                                      
sudo usermod -a -G tty $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
may need to log out / back in

or

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0  (will be required at every login)
