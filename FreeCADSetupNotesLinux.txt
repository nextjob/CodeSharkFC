Linux Mint Install

Install on new build:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install freecad


On Mint (Ubuntu) we need to create these links: rem ln -s source_file symbolic_link

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/freecad/Mod /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Mod
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/freecad/Ext /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Ext

There is also the following issue with the python package on Linux Mint 20.04:
There is no libpython3.8m.so, only libpython3.8.so  https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html 
Python4Delphi has the library names hard coded, must create the following link until this is resolved:

cd /usr/lib/python3.8/config-3.8-x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s ../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.8.so.1 libpython3.8m.so

We need these links because when executing Application startup (import FreeCAD) from an external python interpreter,
AppHomePath is resolved as /usr/lib/freecad-python3 (which is the location of FreeCAD.so).
 (See Application.cpp & FreeCADInit.py in source)
This results in FreeCAD.getHomePath as returning /usr/lib/freecad-python3 and setting the Mod dir as /usr/lib/freecad-python3/Mod.
The correct location is /usr/lib/freecad/Mod, adding these links resolves this issue.


Cannot open /dev/ttyS0: Permission denied                                                      
sudo usermod -a -G tty $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
may need to log out / back in
or

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0  (will require every login)
